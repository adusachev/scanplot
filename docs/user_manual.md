## Installation


At the moment, the algorithm does not have a graphical interface, it can be tested in Jupyter Notebook.


### Way 1: Running in Docker (recommended for quickstart)

**Step 1:** Clone repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/adusachev/scanplot.git <REPO>
cd <REPO>
```

Add your data (plot images) to `<REPO>/datasets/`, so that images can be accessed from inside the Docker container.


**Step 2:** Start Docker container
```sh
docker compose up -d
```

**Step 3:** Go to http://localhost:8888 and run notebook `main.ipynb`

Stop Docker container:
```sh
docker compose down
```

---

### Way 2: Running locally


**Step 0:** Make sure that you have a required python version (> 3.11, < 3.12):
```sh
python3 --version
```

If you don't have the required python version, you can install it using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv).


**Step 1:** Clone repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/adusachev/scanplot.git <REPO>
cd <REPO>
```

**Step 2:** Create virtual environment and install dependencies

with `pip`:
```sh
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
with `poetry`:
```sh
poetry env use python3
poetry shell
poetry install
```

**Step 3:** Open Jupyter Notebook in created virtual environment

**Step 4:** Run notebook `<REPO>/examples/main.ipynb`

## Usage


### Marker selection

You can interactively select the markers that you want to detect on the plot image.

---


### ROI selection

For each choosen marker you can select its own region of interest â€“ the area of the image where detections are allowed.

### Detector


The detector operates in semi-automatic mode.
You need to vary the detector parameters and choose the best result.

The detector has **2 parameters**:
- Points Number
- Points Density


The impact of these parameters on the final result is shown below:

### Mapping coordinates

After applying the detector, you obtain the marker coordinates in **pixels**.

So the last step is to map pixel coordinates to factual chart coordinates.
